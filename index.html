    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>
    The <em>PIO</em> module on the <em>RP2040</em> is quite a powerfull peripheral, 
    especially in terms of carrying out tasks that require precise timings and 
    <em>GPIO</em> control. These tasks include handling communication protocols
    such as SPI, I2C, etc. In this project, we have utilized these capabilities
    of the PIO and the RP2040 as a whole to drive a 640x480 VGA display, and emulate
    the famous game - <em>Piano Tiles</em> integrated with spatial audio to provide an
    immersive experience. In the game, the user needs to intercept the falling tiles
    on the screen using a small base tile that is as the name suggests is present at
    the bottom of the screen. Each time a tile is intercepted a particular note is played.
    The spatial audio like effect is created based on which side the user intercepts the tile,
    i.e. if the tile is intercepted on the left side of the screen, the user will feel that the
    audio is coming from the left side and vice-versa for the right side. Headphones were used
    to implement this feature, driven using the <em>PWM</em> peripheral on the RP2040.

    To get a little motivation for diving further into this, let's have a look at
    the end result.
